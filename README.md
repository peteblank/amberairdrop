# Amberairdrop

This repository will contain the code for the Amber airdrop.

# update
Now it shows the adresses with 70 secrets or more in the citadel node

# update2
Alright, now it should list the 69 nodes that are currently online, the addresses of those that hold more than 70 secrets on each one and it shows the moniker at the beginning.
Now all that's left is making it so it sends amber automatically.

#ps
I'm using two apis from figment so if you want to test it you'll have to go to datahub at figment and get your API key

# update 3
Added a way to query the amount of testnet amber balance in your wallet

# update 4
last update
testnetfinal.js gets all the info and sends tokens on the tesnptnet with testnet tokens.
remember to change .env.testnet... name to .env and input your figment datahub info.
if you need help with datahub go to the figment discord. 
also don't forget to install nodejs, I used nodejs v 17
if you don't know how to use nodejs here's a manual https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_get_started.asp
remember to also install npm and install node-fetch and secrets with npm i node-fetch secretjs
